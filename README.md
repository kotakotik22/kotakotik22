I stop working on projects often, I come back to them sometimes but sometimes I don't

- [X] Currently working on something
- [ ] Doing literally nothing because I'm lazy as hell

Working on:

- [ ] Purpbux
- [ ] XYKey
- [ ] Chaoscraft
- [ ] Kotalib
- [X] Helping with Create railways

I only work on stuff for fun, so if I get bored of working on something, I will work far less, but if it is very fun, I'll work A **LOT**

Also Svelte is pog
